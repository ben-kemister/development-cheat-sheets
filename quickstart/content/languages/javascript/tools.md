This page contains some information about some tools that help with JavaScript development.

# Code Formatting

[Prettier](https://prettier.io) is a popular code formatting tool which can automatically apply white spaces to make javascript more readable. 

# Dynamic Imports

Browser support for Dynamic Imports is still a bit flakey so tools (such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) and [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org)) have been written to help with this.

# Package Managers

Package managers help with downloading all the required libraries to run your JavaScript code.

Two popular package managers are [npm](https://npmjs.com) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

# Transpilers and Compliers

If you want to use ECMAScript 2015 (or newer) or [TypeScript]({% link _languages/typescript.md %}) you will need a Transpiler to convert your JavaScript code into something that most browsers can handle.

[Babel](https://babeljs.io) is a popular JavaScript Transpiler/Compiler which can convert JavaScript to be ES5 compatible.
