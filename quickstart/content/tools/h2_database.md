## Settings of the H2 Console

The settings of the H2 Console are stored in a configuration file called `.h2.server.properties` in you user home directory. For Windows installations, the user home directory is usually `C:\Users\[username]`. The configuration file contains the settings of the application and is automatically created when the H2 Console is first started
