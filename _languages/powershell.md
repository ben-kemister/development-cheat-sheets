hostname
```

## Select-String (i.e. Grep for Powershell)

The `Select-String` command is the PowerShell equivalent to grep in linux.
See [here](https://adamtheautomator.com/powershell-grep/) for more information and examples.

### File input

```shell
Select-String -Path "Users\*.csv" -Pattern "Joe"
```

### Stream input (piped from another command)

``` cmd
git config -l | Select-String -Pattern 'email'
```

## String Concatenation (`+`)

The `+` operator is used to concatenate strings in Powershell, for example:

```shell
$firstName = "Shell"
$lastName = "Geek"

$fullName = $firstName + $lastName

Write-Host "Concatenate String:"
$fullName
```

## Join-Path

If you need to combine (directory) paths in PowerShell you can use `Join-Path`:

```shell
PS C:\> Join-Path -Path "path" -ChildPath "childpath"

path\childpath
```

## Remove-Item - Delete File(s)

You can use the `Remove-Item` function to delete files:

```shell
# For a single file
Remove-Item 'D:\temp\Test Folder\test.txt'

# Or a folder and sub-files/folders recursively with
Remove-Item 'D:\temp\Test Folder' -Recurse
```

## foreach - file

You can you a combination of `Get-ChildItem` and the `foreach` loop to process a set of files:

```shell
# Get all sql files...
$files = Get-ChildItem $DataDir\*.sql
foreach ($file in $files) {
    Write-Output 'Processing sql script: ' $file.Fullname
    ## Do something
}
```

## $PSScriptRoot â€“ Get full path of executing script

`$PSScriptRoot` is an automatic variable in PowerShell which contains the full path to the script.
