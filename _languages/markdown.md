# Collabsible Sections

[This gist post](https://gist.github.com/pierrejoubert73/902cc94d79424356a8d20be2b382e1ab) shows how you can use a collapsible section in markdown.

``` markdown
    # A collapsible section with markdown
    <details>
    <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
    
    ## Heading
    1. A numbered
    2. list
        * With some
        * Sub bullets
    </details>
```

# Blockquotes
To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

``` md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```
The rendered output looks like this:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
