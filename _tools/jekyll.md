tool: 
name: Jekyll

Jekyll is a Ruby tool which can generate static websites and blogs using plain text files.

# Configuration ( `_config.yml`)

## baseurl

Use `baseurl` when you are building a site that doesnâ€™t sit at the root of the domain. For example:

'http://jekyll.github.io/example'

In this case you would need to set `baseurl: /example` in the `_config.yml` file otherwise the automatically generated links will not include the `/example`  in the url path.
