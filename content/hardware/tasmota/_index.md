[Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/About) is open-source firmware primarily designed for ESP8266 and ESP32-based smart home devices, 
enabling local control and customization without relying on proprietary cloud services.

It offers features like MQTT and HTTP control, Web UI access, and over-the-air (OTA) updates. 
Essentially, it allows users to "de-cloud" their smart devices, enhancing privacy and control.

## First Boot

Upon first boot the device will create a WiFi access point and serve a configuration webpage at http://192.168.4.1
