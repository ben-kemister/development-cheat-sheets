## Change/Set IP address

For Debian based distros:

```shell
# find the interface name to change with
$ ifconfig
eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.0.167  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.0.255
        inet6 fe80::e280:ee50:6b3b:efd  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether b8:27:eb:4c:65:1f  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 4534  bytes 831537 (812.0 KiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 1553  bytes 196406 (191.8 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

# change the IP address
sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.5 netmask 255.255.255.0
```

If the IP address revert, check the `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` file

## DNS Server configuration

On most linux systems you can get information about the systems' DNS configuration in the `/etc/resolv.conf` file.

For example:
```shell
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```
```text
search <REDACTED>
nameserver 10.43.0.10
options ndots:5
```


## How to Verify the Speed of the NIC

We can check the speed of our NIC module by using the `/sys` pseudo-filesystem:

```shell
cat /sys/class/net/<interface>/speed
```

The advantage of this method is that we donâ€™t need to install any external software tools.

Before we run the command, we need to know the network interface name. Two easy ways to find it are by using the `ifconfig` command or the `ip` command. 
We can also just list the interfaces within the `/sys/class/net/` directory:

```shell
$ ls /sys/class/net
cni0  enp0s31f6  flannel.1  lo  veth15e576e3  veth409b84fd  vethc1665644  vethf896545a  wlp2s0
```

Then we can run the `cat` command on its speed file. For example, if the interface name is `enp0s31f6` execute:

```shell
$ cat /sys/class/net/enp0s31f6/speed
1000
```
