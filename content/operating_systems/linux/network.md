## How to Verify the Speed of the NIC

We can check the speed of our NIC module by using the `/sys` pseudo-filesystem:

```shell
cat /sys/class/net/<interface>/speed
```

The advantage of this method is that we donâ€™t need to install any external software tools.

Before we run the command, we need to know the network interface name. Two easy ways to find it are by using the `ifconfig` command or the `ip` command. 
We can also just list the interfaces within the `/sys/class/net/` directory:

```shell
$ ls /sys/class/net
cni0  enp0s31f6  flannel.1  lo  veth15e576e3  veth409b84fd  vethc1665644  vethf896545a  wlp2s0
```

Then we can run the `cat` command on its speed file. For example, if the interface name is `enp0s31f6` execute:

```shell
$ cat /sys/class/net/enp0s31f6/speed
1000
```
