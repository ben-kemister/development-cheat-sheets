## Installing/Enabling the Pixel Desktop

The PIXEL (formerly LXDE) desktop environment was removed from the RetroPie image to keep it smaller.

It can easily be installed from the RetroPie Setup Script (`~/RetroPie-Setup/retropie_setup.sh`)

In Configuration / Tools >> Raspbiantools >> Install Pixel Desktop Environment

After installation, it will be accessible from the ports menu of EmulationStation or can be called from the command line with `startx`

For more details see [where did the desktop go](https://retropie.org.uk/docs/FAQ/#where-did-the-desktop-go)

## Setting up Wiimotes

Look at the instructions in the [RetroPie docs](https://retropie.org.uk/docs/Wiimote-Controller/)
