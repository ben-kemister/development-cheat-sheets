This page contains information, syntax, and simple code examples, about the use of collections in Java.

## Arrays

### Arrays.asList(array)

Converts an array of objects into a list, great one-liner to use when you need to iterate over the array.

```java
// Great way to create a collection within one line
List<String> strings = Arrays.asList("one", "two", "three");
```
