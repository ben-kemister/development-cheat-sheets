[Records](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/language/records.html) were introduced in JDK 14 and are a new type 
to assist with creating 'data carrier' objects.
<!--more-->
Like an enum, a `record` is a restricted form of a class. 
It’s ideal for "plain data carriers," classes that contain data not meant to be altered and only the most fundamental 
methods such as constructors and accessors.


## Basics

A `record` is an immutable data class which automatically has a:

1. private, final field for each piece of data
2. getter for each field
3. public constructor with a corresponding argument for each field
4. equals method that returns true for objects of the same class when all fields match
5. hashCode method that returns the same value when all fields match
6. toString method that includes the name of the class and the name of each field and its corresponding value

Using records can remove a lot of boilerplate code.

## Declaration

To create a `TransactionDto` record, we’ll use the `record` keyword:

```java
record TransactionDto (String queueName, String transactionName) {}
```

The `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods, as well as the `private`, `final` fields and public constructor, 
are generated by the Java compiler.

Records can be declared at the class level or within a method.

## Constructor

The constructor can be used in the same way as a class to instantiate objects from the `record`:

```java
TransactionDto transaction = new TransactionDto("Queue 1", "My Transaction");
```
