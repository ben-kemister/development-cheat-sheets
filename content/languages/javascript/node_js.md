Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. 

Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. 

Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js)

# Node Versions and ES Support

According to [node.green](https://node.green/) version 10, or higher, covers 99%  of ES2015 (ES6) support.

# NPM (Node Package Manager)

>Note: Most of the commands below can be run in **Global** mode by appending `-g` or `--global` to the command.

## `install` a package

Project dependencies (packages) are installed by using the cli command `npm install <package>` or `npm i <package>`.

### Install Dev Dependencies

To install a library as a Dev package use the `--save-dev` at the end:

```powershell
PS> npm i ts-jest --save-dev
# Installs as a devDependencies in the package.json
PS> npm i jest --save-dev
````

### Install a specific version

By default npm will install the latest version of a package, you can override this behavior if you need to install a specific version by using the following cli syntax `npm i <package>@<version>`. If you want that exact version specified in your `package.json` dependencies add the `--save --save-exact` flags. for example:

```powershell
# Removes the package and updates the package.json
PS> npm i serverless-offline@5.12.1 --save-dev --save-exact
```

## `remove` a package

Packages can be removed by using the cli command `npm remove <package>`. To also update the `package.json` file add the `--save` flag:

```powershell
# Removes the package and updates the package.json
PS> npm remove jest --save
```

## [list](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ls.html) packages installed

The `npm list` command will print to stdout all the versions of packages that are installed, as well as their dependencies, in a tree-structure.

```powershell
# Prints out all packages for the project
PS> npm list

# Prints out the version of the `tuyapi` package
PS> npm list tuyapi

# To see which global libraries are installed and where they're located
PS> npm list -g

# To see just the path run
PS> npm list -g | head -1
```

## [outdated](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/outdated) packages

The `npm outdated [<package> ...]` command  will check the registry to see if any (or, specific) installed packages are currently outdated.

```shell
/etc/openhab2/scripts/tuya-mqtt$ npm outdated
Package        Current  Wanted  Latest  Location
color-convert    1.9.3   1.9.3   2.0.1  tuya-mqtt
mqtt             3.0.0   3.0.0   4.0.0  tuya-mqtt
tuyapi           5.1.3   5.2.1   5.2.1  tuya-mqtt
/etc/openhab2/scripts/tuya-mqtt$
```

## [update](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/update) packages

The `npm update [-g] [<pkg>...]` command will update all the packages listed to the latest version.

```shell
/etc/openhab2/scripts/tuya-mqtt$ npm update tuyapi
+ tuyapi@5.2.1
updated 3 packages and audited 357 packages in 10.155s
/etc/openhab2/scripts/tuya-mqtt$
```

## [clean-install (ci)](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-ci)

The `npm clean-install` or `npm ci` is similar to `npm install`, except it's meant to be used in automated environments such as test platforms, continuous integration, and deployment -- or any situation where you want to make sure you're doing a clean install of your dependencies.

## [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-link/)

This command is handy if you are actively working on a module and would like these changes reflected immediately within the containing project/app.

Firstly, it creates a global link to the folder containing the source code for the folder.
Then you link the parent app/project to the global link so that it uses the source code folder, rather than the real npm module.

```shell
cd ~/projects/some-module       # go into the package directory
npm link                        # creates global link
cd ~/projects/node-bloggy-app   # go into some other package directory.
npm link some-module            # link-install the package
```
