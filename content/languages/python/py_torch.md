[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open-source machine learning library primarily used for building and training 
deep learning models.
<!--more-->
It is based on the Torch library and offers a Python-based high-level API, making it popular in academic and research 
communities for its flexibility and ease of use.

## Setup/Installation

The best way to get started with PyTorch is to use the selectors on the PyTorch [Get Started page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

This will provide you with a command line to run which will install the PyTorch dependencies (including CUDA components).
