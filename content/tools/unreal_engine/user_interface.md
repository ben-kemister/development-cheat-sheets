You can organise the assets in your world by creating and using folders within Outliner.

## Troubleshooting

### Mouse disappears in Viewport

It looks like this is a long-standing bug, to workaround use a custom mouse pointer as described in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz2sMYPAQDU).

Settings --> Accessibility --> Mouse --> Mouse Pointer --> Mouse Pointer Style --> Select 'Custom'
