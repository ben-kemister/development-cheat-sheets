[Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) is an open source registry that secures artifacts with policies and role-based access control, 
ensures images are scanned and free from vulnerabilities, and signs images as trusted.

Harbor, a CNCF Graduated project, delivers compliance, performance, and interoperability to help you consistently and 
securely manage artifacts across cloud native compute platforms like Kubernetes and Docker.

## Configure Proxy Cache
