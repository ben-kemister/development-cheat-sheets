## Attributes

When configuring an agent for an application there are a number of ways to set the high level attributes 
(such as `service.name`, `deployment.environment.name` etc).

You can set these attributes via environment variables, (Java) system properties, or using a configuration file.

### Handy Attributes

For a full list of attributes available (and their status/stability) see [Attribute Registry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/).
