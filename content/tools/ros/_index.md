[Robot Operating System](https://www.ros.org/) (ROS or ros) is an open-source robotics middleware suite. 
<!--more-->
Although ROS is not an operating system (OS) but a set of software frameworks for robot software development, 
it provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, 
implementation of commonly used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.
