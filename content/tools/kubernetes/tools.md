## k9s

[K9s](https://k9scli.io/) is a terminal based UI to interact with your Kubernetes clusters. 
The aim of this project is to make it easier to navigate, observe and manage your deployed applications in the wild. 
K9s continually watches Kubernetes for changes and offers subsequent commands to interact with your observed resources.

The binaries can be downloaded from their [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/derailed/k9s/releases).
