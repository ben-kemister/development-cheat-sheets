cert-manager adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, 
and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing and using those certificates.

As of early 2024 it is a CNCF Incubating Project in the [Security & Compliance](https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?category=security-compliance&grouping=category&zoom=120) 
category.
