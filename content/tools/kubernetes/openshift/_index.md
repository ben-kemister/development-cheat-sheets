## Project wide node selectors

You can use an annotations on a Namespace to be able to set the default node selector for any Pods (including those 
created by Deployments) which are created in that Namespace.

For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  annotations: 
    # Schedule Pods onto the Nodes that are assigned the 'app' node-role.
    openshift.io/node-selector: "node-role.kubernetes.io/app="
  name: demo-namespace
```

The namespace annotation will **add** to any `nodeSelector` specified in the Pod's manifest, which can cause Pods to enter 
a _Pending_ status if a node with matching labels cannot be found.

For more information on this feature see [Creating project-wide node selectors](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-node-selectors.html#nodes-scheduler-node-selectors-project_nodes-scheduler-node-selectors)

## Troubleshooting

### oc long returns `net/http: TLS handshake timeout`

This can be caused by the `oc` client/machine not trusting the TLS certificate/s presented by the server.
You can get this messages if you yet to set up cert-manager on the cluster with your trusted certificates.

You can bypass this by adding `--insecure-skip-tls-verify=true` to your login command, for example:

```shell
oc login -u <USER_ID> --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
```
