A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that excels at processing, understanding, and generating human language.

LLMs are useful for analyzing, summarizing, and creating content across many industries.


## Common AI Model Formats

### GGUF

GGUF was initially developed for the [llama.cpp project](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp). 
GGUF is a binary format designed for fast model loading and saving, and for ease of readability. 
GGUF is primarily used for serving language models in production environments, where fast loading times are crucial.
Models are typically developed using PyTorch or another framework, and then converted to GGUF for use with GGML.

Pros:
* Fast loading and saving.
* Supported by popular inference runtimes like llama.cpp, ollama, and vLLM.
* Flexible quantization schemes (e.g., Q4_K_M, IQ2_M) for efficient storage.
* Widely used in the open-source community for language models.

Cons:
* Limited support for non-language models (e.g., diffusion models).
* Difficult to modify or fine-tune directly; requires special scripts.
* Not ideal for environments requiring frequent model updates or adjustments.

### PyTorch (.pt/.pth)

Pros:
* Native format for PyTorch models.
* Easy to use within Python environments.
* Supports saving model weights, optimizer states, and training metadata.

Cons:
* Relies on Python's pickle module, which can be insecure or inefficient.
* Not suitable for cross-framework compatibility.
* Less secure and less efficient than newer formats like Safetensors.

### Safetensors

Pros:
* Developed by Hugging Face for improved security and efficiency.
* Prevents code execution vulnerabilities during deserialization.
* Used as the default format in the transformers library.
* Easier to modify and manage metadata (e.g., tokenizer configurations).

Cons:
* Metadata is often stored in a separate JSON file, which can be inconvenient.
* Less flexible than ONNX for complex model architectures.

### ONNX (.onnx)

Pros:
* Vendor-neutral format with a computation graph included.
* Enables interoperability across frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).
* Useful for deployment on mobile or in-browser environments.

Cons:
* Larger file sizes due to the inclusion of the computation graph.
* Less optimized for fast inference compared to GGUF or Safetensors.
