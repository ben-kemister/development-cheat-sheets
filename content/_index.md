## Welcome and What is this...?

Welcome to the archived parts of my *development brain*... what?

As a busy, full stack, multi-language developer working on multiple projects I have come to realise that there is a limit 
to how much I can fit into my head at the same time.

In my experience if I am actively using a few a languages or tools these will be at the front of mind and quick to access 
and use for solving the problems at hand.

But what about those things (languages, tools, techniques) you are not using so often? 
Maybe you previously solved a problem using a certain tool but if you are not actively using that tool now, maybe it has been a while, what then? 
Maybe you are just starting to learn a new language or tool, but you are still getting the hang of the syntax.

Sure you could try to mine the depths of your memories, or google hard until you stumble blindly across it (or an alternative). But this just seems a little at odd with me, remember you have done this before, you just need a little reminder!

Enter this site. 
This site (and the GitHub repo that backs it) is my attempt to capture those little notes, those little 'ahaa' moments when you just got it. 
When things just clicked, and you got that concept or the job done.

This site enables me to archive those thoughts and (hopefully) be able to easily find them and use them when they are needed next time. 
The information here is not intended to be a tutorial, although my contain links to some, but merely serves as a nudge to quickly recall a technical topic or solution, a *cheat sheet*.

If you have stumbled upon this site and find its contents useful, that is fantastic! Happy to have helped!

Regardless of how you have arrived here, Welcome to my **Development Cheat Sheets!**
