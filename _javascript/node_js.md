title: Node.js
---

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. 

Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. 

Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js)
