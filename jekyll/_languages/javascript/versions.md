# Versions
ECMASscript 5 (also known as ES5) is compatible with all major web browers.

There are newer versions (ECMAScript 2015 a.k.a. ES6) released every year, but to maintain backwards compatibility you may need to use a **Transpiler** to convert it into ES5 or ES6.

# Transpilers

bablejs.io is a popular Transpiler.
